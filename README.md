<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation

1. Download latest release
2. Unpack the addons/simple_card_pile_ui folder into your /addons folder within the Godot project
3. Enable this addon within the Godot settings: Project > Project Settings > Plugins

<a name="getting-started"></a>
## Getting Started

1. Create a script extending `CardUIData` that describes any custom properties your card will need. You can utlize inheritance here as needed. 
2. Create a JSON database of your card information ([example](#json-database)).
3. Create a JSON collection of your cards ([example](#json-collection)).
4. Create a new scene with root type `CardUI` - this is the object that displays in game. This object must have 2 TextureRect as children named `Frontface` and `Backface`. It will warn you if configured incorrectly. 
5. Add a `CardPileUI` node to your game scene and configure its settings.
6. Begin building your game with the provided methods and signals.

## Concepts
**Card Pile UI** - this is the manager for all cards in a collection.

**Card UI Data** - this represents any custom data that your cards use.

**Card UI** - this is the in-game representation of your card data, this holds and displays **Card UI Data**

**Card Dropzone** - this is a designated space where if a player drops a card something occurs. It can also stack cards, removing them from the standard draw/hand/discard piles.

**Draw Pile** - this is a pile containing cards that a player draws from during the game.

**Hand Pile** - this is a pile containing cards currently held by a player.

**Discard Pile** - this is a pile containing cards that have been discarded during the game.

**Card Removal from Game**, this occurs when a card is permanently removed from play

### Card Database JSON
The Card Database serves as the foundation for all card data in your game. 

Minimally viable card database:
```
[
  {
	"nice_name": "My Card",
	"texture_path": "res://path/to/card_front.png",
	"backface_texture_path": "res://path/to/card_back.png",
	"resource_script_path": "res://path/to/card_data.gd"
  }
]
```

| Name | Description |
|-|-
| nice_name | A unique name for this card
| texture_path | Filepath to the card's front texture
| backface_texture_path | Filepath to the card's back texture
| resource_script_path | Filepath to the card's resource script. If you don't need any custom functionality, you can point this to `res://addons/simple_card_pile_ui/card_ui_data.gd`
| * | You can add more data as needed


<a name="json-collection"></a>
### Card Collection JSON
This represents the cards that begin in the draw pile.

Example:
```
 [ "My Card", "My Card", "My Other Card", "My Other Card" ]
```

## To Do List
- Add support for multiple hands to use the same card pile
- Add more shuffle methods
- Add more sort methods
- Document new properties/methods into the read me
